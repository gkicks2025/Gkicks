# 3D Model Support Implementation

## Database Migration Required

To complete the 3D model upload functionality, you need to run the database migration script to add the required fields to the products table.

### Steps to Apply Migration:

1. **Using MySQL Command Line:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p gkicks_db < database/add-3d-model-field.sql
   ```

2. **Using phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench:**
   - Open the `database/add-3d-model-field.sql` file
   - Copy and execute the SQL commands in your MySQL client

3. **Manual SQL Commands:**
   ```sql
   USE gkicks_db;
   
   ALTER TABLE products 
   ADD COLUMN model_3d_url TEXT AFTER gallery_images,
   ADD COLUMN model_3d_filename VARCHAR(255) AFTER model_3d_url;
   
   ALTER TABLE products 
   MODIFY COLUMN model_3d_url TEXT COMMENT '3D model file URL path',
   MODIFY COLUMN model_3d_filename VARCHAR(255) COMMENT 'Original filename of the 3D model';
   
   CREATE INDEX idx_has_3d_model ON products (model_3d_url(100));
   ```

## Features Implemented

✅ **API Endpoint**: `/api/upload-3d-models` - Handles OBJ file uploads
✅ **File Validation**: Accepts only .obj files up to 200MB
✅ **Admin Interface**: 3D model upload fields in both Add and Edit product dialogs
✅ **Product Interface**: Updated to include `model_3d_url` and `model_3d_filename` fields
✅ **File Storage**: 3D models stored in `public/uploads/3d-models/` directory
✅ **UI Components**: Upload progress indicators and file management

## Usage

1. Navigate to Admin → Inventory
2. Click "Add Product" or edit an existing product
3. Scroll to the "3D Model (Optional)" section
4. Upload an OBJ file (max 50MB)
5. The file will be uploaded and the URL stored in the database

## File Structure

```
public/uploads/3d-models/
├── [timestamp]-[original-filename].obj
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

- Run the database migration script
- Test the 3D model upload functionality
- Integrate with a 3D viewer library (Three.js, etc.) to display the models
- Add 3D model preview in the product detail pages
